Here, we're just trying to achieve code execution after uploading a file. 

Lets say you have a website which only allows you to upload only png or jpg files, you can look into the devtools to see whether it checks whether the file is a png or not.

For example, if you're injecting a php file, you can run any command using this as your php file thing when editing things on burpsuite clientside:

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
