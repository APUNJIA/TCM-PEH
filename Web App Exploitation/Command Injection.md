It is a very serious vulnerability because when we find it, we can compromise the entire application hence the host. The way we come about it is that the application takes input from the user then passing that into a function that executes it as code.

Basically dont use functions like eval() in the console section of your browser.

Whenever we're writing programs we need to make sure that we do not trust the input coming from the user or any other system for that matter.
