Some applications use XML(Extensible Markup Language) to transfer data. The format has a specification that contains some potentially dangerous features and therefore parsers that process the data and pass it on can sometimes be vulnerable to attack.

XXE stands for External Entities Injection. An external entity is a custom entity whose definition is outside the documents and therefore needs to be located when the XML file is passed. We can abuse this to do things like read files and in some cases, even gain remote code execution.

XML entry is a simple way of representing data or special characters. 

For the XXE TCM lab, go to:

```bash
cd ~/peh/labs/user-content
```
