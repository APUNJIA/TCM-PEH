IDOR stands for Insecure Direct Object Reference and essentially its an access control issue where we can request a resource with an object ID and it returns some information of that object. Examples of object IDs are things like user IDs, product IDs, etc. 

This vulnerability is fairly trivial to find and exploit, and we actually see it a lot in API driven applications. In that situation we call it BOLA(Broken Object Level Authorization). So basically, BOLA and IDOR are the same vulnerability. 

The easiest way to test for IDOR is essentially, find a point where you're able to manipulate an object's ID and then change it. 

For fuzzing, you can use the following command:

```bash
ffuf -u 'URL/FUZZ' -w <wordlist> 
```

-u is for URL, -w is for wordlist. ffuf is a great tool for directory fuzzing

-fs is filter size.
