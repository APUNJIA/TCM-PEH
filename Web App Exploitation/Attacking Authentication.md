Authentication is a critical component of application security, and often basic attacks are overlooked. Many of the flaws are logic based which makes it inherently interesting. This means that we usually look to review the authentication flow, and then come up with edge cases to break it. 

Authentication is who you are, its your identity. Its like showing your passport or ID when you check into a hotel. 

Authorization is what you're allowed to do. So, once you're checked into the hotel, you get a card key. You can use this to access your room, the pool etc. 

There are 2 ways where we can look into attacking authentication:

1. Brute Force Way
2. Logic Issues

If you want to use ffuf for brute force, you can add in a post request into a txt file(put FUZZ into the parameter you want to fuzz) and use ffuf to read that request with the -request tag and then use a wordlist like you normally do

```bash
ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -w <wordlist>
```
