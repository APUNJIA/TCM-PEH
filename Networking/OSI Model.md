The **OSI** (OpenSystems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes functions of a communication system into **7** distinct layers. Each layer has specific responsibilities and interacts with the layers above and below it. Here's what the different layers are:

1) **Physical Layer** - data cables, cat6
2) **Data Layer** - Switching, [[MAC Addresses]]
3) **Network Layer** - [[IP Addresses]], Routing
4) **Transport Layer** - TCP/UDP ([[TCP, UDP and the Three-Way Handshake]])
5) **Session Layer** - Session management
6) **Presentation Layer** - WMV, JPEG, MOV
7) **Application Layer** - HTTP, SMTP (more about protocols on [[Common Ports and Protocols]])
