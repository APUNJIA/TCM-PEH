We can open metasploit by typing msfconsole in the terminal. Then we can search for the vulnerability that we're trying to exploit using the search feature. 

Choose the appropriate exploit and type options to see what all information do you need to provide. 

Once you're done, type exploit. And then it will start its brute-force attack on the machine at hand.

If you want to change payload option, use this syntax:

```
set payload <name_of_payload>
```

Now again as I mentioned previously, you wont be given the privilege to use metasploit on certs like OSCP so, you need to learn how to exploit a vulnerability manually.
