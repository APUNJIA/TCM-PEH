This part is in conjunction with [[Researching Potential Vulnerabilities]]. You find a vulnerability and then you google it for a way to exploit it. In the case of a manually downloadable exploit, see if it is safe to run on your machine, and then run it. 

Most of the time, the exploit has a procedure that is mentioned where the code is stored. But its mostly just unzipping the contents and running the script by using the appropriate compiler.
