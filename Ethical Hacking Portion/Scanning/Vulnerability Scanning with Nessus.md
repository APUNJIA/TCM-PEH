Nessus is a vulnerability scanner. Download the debian package for your kali linux and then run the following command on the terminal in the directory you downloaded the file:

```bash
dpkg -i Nessus[tab_to_autocomplete XD]
```

Then run nessus by: 

```bash
/etc/init.d/nessus start
```

In the free version of nessus, we can scan any private IP address and we can scan upto 16 of those at one time.

Then you can do enumeration using nessus for any vulnhub type CTFs that you're doing. It basically automates the enumeration process. 

Then what you can do is, after your scan is done, you can download all the info in a nessus file and then show it to your shareholders and other people who might be interested.
