You can google exploits for different versions of software that you find during your enumeration. One very important website is https://exploit-db.com. Just make sure to see if the code given on the website is safe to run on your PC or not. 

cvedetails is also a good website to trust when you're looking for vulnerabilities. If the colour next to the vulnerability is red, that means you have found something juicy.

Rapid7 is amazing. If you find a vulnerability on rapid7 you're lucky because rapid7 makes metasploit. 

Lets say you cannot run a browser for some reason, you can also use a terminal tool called searchsploit.

Note: You don't have to be too specific with searchsploit, the more specific you are, the more off you are. This is because it searches for the exact string that you're typing. Syntax:

```bash
searchsploit <name_of_vuln>
```
