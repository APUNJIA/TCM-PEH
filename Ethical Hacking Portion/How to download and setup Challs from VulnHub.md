We will go through the steps to download Kioptrix. A very easy machine on Vulnhub. 

1) The official file on vulnhub is very old so we will go to https://tcm.sec.com/kioptrix and download the .ova file from there.
2) Once done, just run it on VMWare or Virtualbox or any other virtualization software. Be sure to give atleast 512 MB of RAM to the machine
3) Its also important to give the network adapter as NAT. Otherwise lets say you're running your Kali Box to hack this machine, you wont be able to do that as you wont be able to run tools like nmap.
