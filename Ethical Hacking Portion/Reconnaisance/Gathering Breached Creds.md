For gathering Breached Credentials, you can use the following tools. Again, use these tools after you've gained consent from the company and all that jazz. 

1) Breach-Parse: Breach parse is a program made by Heath Adams(TCM) to parse breached passwords.

Link: https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse

Basically it uses data from data breaches that you have downloaded and then presents them in a clean manner. 

2) DeHashed: Basically you can use this to find email accounts with breached credentials and then you can maybe use them to find their personal accounts as well. Because it hashes the password and then compares it to other sites' data breaches and then finds correlations. You can use another site in tandem with this. The name of the site is hases.org
